# Grocery-App
Introducing our grocery app - a user-friendly and intuitive mobile application designed to help you manage your grocery list with ease. With its simple and straightforward interface, you can easily add, remove, or edit grocery items at any time, and keep track of your grocery shopping in a hassle-free way.

1. One of the key features of the app is its use of the MVVM architecture pattern, which ensures that the user interface and the underlying data are kept separate. This makes the app more scalable and easier to maintain, while also improving the overall performance and user experience.

2. In addition, the app leverages Kodein dependency injection, which enables the app to easily manage its dependencies and decouple its components. This allows the app to be more modular and flexible, making it easier to modify and extend as needed.

3. To store and manage the grocery data, the app uses Room database, which is a robust and efficient library for building database-backed applications. With Room, the app can easily store, retrieve, and update grocery items, while also providing powerful querying capabilities.

With our grocery app, you can easily enter a grocery item and increase or decrease the amount of it as needed, ensuring that your grocery list is always up-to-date. So whether you're planning a big shopping trip or just need to pick up a few things, our grocery app is the perfect tool to help you stay organized and save time.
